## Implementation Architecture

### AccessibilityManager Autoload
```gdscript
# Core accessibility system controller
enum AccessibilityMode { NONE, VISUAL, AUDITORY, MOTOR, COGNITIVE, COMPREHENSIVE }
var active_accessibility_features: Dictionary = {}
var accessibility_settings: AccessibilitySettings
```

### Settings Integration
```gdscript
# Add to GameSettings
@export var accessibility_high_contrast: bool = false
@export var accessibility_colorblind_mode: String = "none"
@export var accessibility_text_scale: float = 1.0
@export var accessibility_reduce_motion: bool = false
@export var accessibility_mono_audio: bool = false
@export var accessibility_subtitle_enabled: bool = false
@export var accessibility_simple_ui: bool = false
```

### UI Component Extensions
- **AccessibleButton** - Enhanced button with screen reader support
- **AccessibleLabel** - Text with scaling and contrast options
- **AccessibleProgressBar** - Visual and audio progress indicators
- **AccessibleMenu** - Navigation with keyboard and voice support

## Content Guidelines

### Visual Design
- **Minimum contrast ratio** of 4.5:1 for normal text
- **Alternative text** for all images and icons
- **Consistent visual hierarchy** throughout the interface
- **Multiple ways** to convey important information
- **Scalable vector graphics** for crisp scaling

### Audio Design
- **Clear speech synthesis** for screen readers
- **Distinct audio cues** for different types of events
- **Spatial audio** for directional information
- **Volume level consistency** across all audio content
- **Audio alternatives** for visual-only information

### Interaction Design
- **Multiple input methods** for every action
- **Generous click targets** (minimum 44px touch targets)
- **Clear focus indicators** for keyboard navigation
- **Predictable interaction patterns** across the game
- **Error prevention** and clear error messages

## Platform-Specific Features
