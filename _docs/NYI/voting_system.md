# Voting System Implementation Plan

**Status**: Not Yet Implemented  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 development sessions  
**Dependencies**: UI System, GameManager, TutorialManager (future), MapStateInterface

## System Overview

Universal voting system supporting multiple voting contexts including tutorial skip voting, map path selection, and future gameplay decisions. Provides fair, transparent, and customizable voting mechanics for all multiplayer decision points.

## Voting Architecture Core

### Universal Voting Framework
- **VotingManager autoload** for centralized vote coordination
- **Voting session management** with timeout and result handling
- **Configurable voting rules** for different contexts
- **Vote tracking and validation** for fair outcomes
- **UI abstraction layer** for different voting interfaces

### Vote Types and Contexts
- **Tutorial Skip Voting** - Skip seen tutorials when majority agrees
- **Map Path Voting** - Choose next map node when multiple paths available
- **Gameplay Decision Voting** - Future minigame choices and settings
- **Session Control Voting** - Restart, quit, settings changes

## Tutorial Skip Voting System

### Voting Trigger Conditions
- **Minimum tutorial duration** passed before voting enabled
- **Player familiarity threshold** based on tutorial view history
- **All players present** requirement for valid voting
- **Auto-skip bypass** when settings allow individual skipping

### Tutorial Vote Flow
1. **Tutorial Presentation** begins with skip voting disabled
2. **Minimum Duration** timer enables voting interface
3. **Player Vote Collection** with clear voting UI
4. **Vote Threshold Check** based on configured requirements
5. **Result Application** either skip to gameplay or continue tutorial

### Tutorial Vote Configuration
- **Vote threshold types** - unanimous, majority, or weighted voting
- **Timeout settings** - maximum voting duration before auto-decision
- **Repeat viewing handling** - different rules for familiar content
- **Individual preferences** - respect players who always want to skip

## Map Path Voting System

### Map Navigation Context
- **Multiple available paths** from current map node
- **Path information display** showing destination types and difficulty
- **Strategic decision making** based on player preferences and risk tolerance
- **Consensus building** for party coordination

### Map Vote Scenarios
- **Branch Selection** - Choose between 2-3 available map paths
- **Risk Assessment** - Vote on high-risk/high-reward vs safe paths
- **Minigame Preference** - Select specific minigame types when available
- **Resource Management** - Decide on shop visits, rest stops, or challenges

### Map Vote Flow
1. **Path Options Presentation** with detailed information about each choice
2. **Player Discussion Period** for strategic planning and negotiation
3. **Vote Collection** with ranked preference or simple selection
4. **Tie-Breaking Mechanism** for deadlocked votes
5. **Path Commitment** and progression to selected node

### Map Vote Information Display
- **Path Difficulty Indicators** showing challenge level and requirements
- **Reward Previews** indicating potential gains from each path
- **Player Readiness Status** showing individual player preferences
- **Time Pressure Indicators** when votes have time limits

## Universal Voting Configuration

### Voting Rules Framework
- **Threshold Requirements** - percentage or absolute number needed
- **Timeout Behavior** - default choice when time expires
- **Anonymous vs Open** voting for different contexts
- **Vote Weight Customization** for different player roles or achievements
- **Veto Power** for specific voting contexts

### Vote Collection Methods
- **Simultaneous Voting** - all players vote at once with hidden choices
- **Sequential Voting** - players vote in turn order with visible choices
- **Ranked Choice** - players order preferences for complex decisions
- **Approval Voting** - players can approve multiple options

### Fairness and Anti-Griefing
- **Vote Validation** ensuring only eligible players can vote
- **Duplicate Vote Prevention** with secure vote tracking
- **Timeout Protection** preventing stalling tactics
- **Historical Vote Tracking** for pattern analysis and fairness

## UI/UX Design Principles

### Voting Interface Standards
- **Clear Vote Options** with visual previews and descriptions
- **Vote Status Indicators** showing who has voted and current tally
- **Time Remaining Display** with appropriate urgency indicators
- **Result Presentation** with clear outcome explanation

### Context-Specific Interfaces
- **Tutorial Voting** - Minimal overlay preserving tutorial visibility
- **Map Path Voting** - Comprehensive interface with path details
- **Quick Decision Voting** - Streamlined interface for rapid choices
- **Strategic Voting** - Detailed interface supporting discussion

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Multiple Input Methods** supporting various accessibility needs
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy** for different voting options
- **Audio Cues** for vote state changes and deadlines
- **Keyboard Navigation** for interface accessibility

## Technical Implementation

### VotingManager Architecture
- **Vote Session Management** tracking active voting contexts
- **Player Vote Storage** with validation and security
- **Result Calculation** using configurable algorithms
- **Event Broadcasting** for vote state changes and results

### Database Integration
- **Vote History Tracking** for analytics and pattern recognition
- **Player Voting Preferences** for personalized default settings
- **Voting Behavior Analytics** for system optimization
- **Fraud Detection Data** for security monitoring

### Performance Considerations
- **Lightweight Vote Collection** minimizing network overhead
- **Efficient Vote Validation** using optimized algorithms
- **Scalable Vote Storage** supporting various session sizes
- **Responsive UI Updates** maintaining smooth user experience

## Settings Integration

### Global Voting Preferences
- **Default Vote Behavior** when player doesn't actively vote
- **Auto-Vote Thresholds** for automatic decision making
- **Voting Timeout Preferences** for different contexts
- **Privacy Settings** for anonymous vs open voting

### Context-Specific Settings
- **Tutorial Auto-Skip Rules** based on familiarity and preferences
- **Map Path Risk Tolerance** for automatic weighted voting
- **Quick Decision Automation** for time-sensitive votes
- **Participation Requirements** for optional vs mandatory voting

## EventBus Integration

### Voting Event Signals
- **Vote Session Started** with context and options
- **Player Vote Cast** with anonymization for privacy
- **Vote Threshold Reached** with early completion
- **Vote Session Completed** with final results and actions
- **Vote Timeout Warning** for deadline approaching

### Cross-System Communication
- **Tutorial System Integration** for skip vote handling
- **Map System Integration** for path selection results
