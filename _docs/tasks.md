# Forked Fates - Development Tasks & Context

**Project Type**: Mario Party-style Minigame Collection with Slay the Spire Map Progression  
**Engine**: Godot 4.4.1  
**Current Status**: Component-based architecture implemented, critical bugs identified  
**Last Updated**: Current Analysis

## üéÆ Project Vision

**Forked Fates** combines:
- **Mario Party-style minigames** for varied party gameplay experiences
- **Slay the Spire-style map progression** with node-based advancement
- **Duck Game-style ragdoll physics** for chaotic combat mechanics

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. Players navigate a procedurally generated map with connected nodes
2. Each node represents a different minigame or event
3. Minigames determine player progression, rewards, and relationships
4. Players advance through the map until reaching the final confrontation

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ **Implemented & Working**
- **Component-based Player System**: Movement, Health, Inventory, Input, Ragdoll components
- **Minigame Framework**: 3-tier system (Physics/UI/Turn-based minigames)
- **Signal Architecture**: EventBus for decoupled communication
- **Object Pooling**: Performance optimization for bullets/items
- **Factory Patterns**: Consistent object creation
- **One Complete Minigame**: Sudden Death elimination combat

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Implemented**
- **Map System**: UI placeholder exists, generation logic needed
- **AI System**: Architecture ready, no implementation
- **Additional Minigames**: Framework supports many, only one exists

### ‚ùå **Not Started**
- **Assets**: Using placeholder graphics/audio
- **Networking**: Architecture ready for multiplayer

## üêõ CRITICAL BUGS (Fix Immediately)

### 1. **EventBus Signal Parameter Mismatch** üö®
**File**: `autoloads/event_bus.gd` vs `scripts/player/base_player.gd`
```gdscript
# Signal defined with 2 params:
signal player_health_changed(player_id: int, new_health: int)

# Emitted with 3 params:
EventBus.player_health_changed.emit(player_data.player_id, new_health, max_health)
```
**Impact**: Runtime errors, UI updates failing

### 2. **GameConfig Access Pattern Bug** üö®
**Files**: All player components (`health_component.gd`, `movement_component.gd`, etc.)
```gdscript
# INCORRECT - Resource doesn't have .get() method:
max_health = player.game_config.default_max_health if player.game_config.has_method("get") and player.game_config.get("default_max_health", null) != null else max_health

# SHOULD BE:
max_health = player.game_config.default_max_health if player.game_config else max_health
```
**Impact**: Configuration values not loading, potential crashes

### 3. **Null Safety Crash Risk** üí•
**File**: `scripts/player/components/base_component.gd:22`
```gdscript
Logger.debug("Component " + get_class() + " initialized for " + player.player_data.player_name, get_class())
```
**Issue**: `player.player_data` can be null during initialization
**Impact**: Game crashes during player spawning

### 4. **Bullet Collision Logic Error** üéØ
**File**: `scripts/items/bullet.gd:82-85`
```gdscript
if body == shooter:
    has_hit = false  # BUG: This can cause multiple collision processing
    return
```
**Impact**: Bullets hitting multiple targets, performance issues

### 5. **Incorrect Super() Calls** üîÑ
**File**: `scripts/minigames/core/ui_minigame.gd`
```gdscript
func _on_pause() -> void:
    super._ready()  # WRONG: Should be super()
```
**Impact**: Inherited functionality not working properly

## üîß **Development Guidelines**

### **For Minigame Development**
1. Choose appropriate base class (PhysicsMinigame/UIMinigame/TurnBasedMinigame)
2. Implement required virtual methods
3. Use standard managers where possible
4. Test with 2-4 players
5. Add to MinigameRegistry

### **For Bug Fixes**
1. Create reproduction case
2. Fix root cause, not symptoms
3. Test related functionality
4. Update any affected documentation
5. Verify no regressions

### **For New Features**

2. Use factory patterns for object creation
3. Emit events through EventBus
4. Add proper error handling
5. Include configuration options
